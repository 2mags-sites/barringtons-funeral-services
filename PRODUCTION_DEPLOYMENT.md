## ðŸš€ Ready for Production Deployment

This website is now ready for production deployment. Follow these steps to go live:

## 1. Pre-Deployment Setup (Local)

### âœ… Update .env File
Edit `.env` with your production credentials:

```env
# Generate random strings for these (32+ characters)
ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_RANDOM_32_CHAR_STRING_HERE
CACHE_CLEAR_KEY=YOUR_DIFFERENT_RANDOM_STRING_HERE

# Update email addresses if needed
CONTACT_TO_EMAIL=info@barringtonsfunerals.co.uk

# Add your SendGrid API key
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.YOUR_ACTUAL_SENDGRID_API_KEY_HERE

# Update domain
APP_URL=https://barringtonsfunerals.co.uk
```

**To generate secure random strings:**
