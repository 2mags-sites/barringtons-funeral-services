            "Following the Competition and Market Authority's (CMA) market investigation into the funeral sector it is compulsory that every funeral director has a Standard Price List. The price list should be available on their website, in the window of their branch, and available to be taken away for reflection.",

There are additional options that can be added to the service which are included in the Additional Options Price List at the bottom of the page. In most cases however if you do not want the fixed Standard Funeral Option the best value is achieved by choosing our bespoke service."
