        "fullDescription": "Direct cremation is a simple, dignified option without a traditional funeral service. This choice is increasingly popular for those who prefer privacy, simplicity, or plan to hold a memorial service at a later date. Despite being our most affordable option, we maintain the same high standards of care and respect. Your loved one is cared for in our funeral home, and you can arrange a viewing if desired as an additional option. The cremation takes place at a time chosen by the crematorium, without attendees, and the ashes are returned to you afterwards. This allows complete flexibility in how and when you choose to remember your loved one, whether through a memorial service, ash scattering ceremony, or private family gathering.",

Many families choose direct cremation specifically because it allows them to plan a memorial service or celebration of life at a later date, in a location and format that feels right for them. This could be in your home, a favorite location, or any venue you choose."

                "question": "Can we scatter or keep the ashes?",
                "answer": "Yes, the ashes are yours to keep, scatter, bury, or place in a memorial location of your choice. We can provide guidance on scattering locations and memorial options."

                "question": "Is direct cremation right for everyone?",

However, if a traditional funeral service is important to you or your family, we offer comprehensive traditional options as well."
