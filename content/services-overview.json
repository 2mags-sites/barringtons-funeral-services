            "fullDescription": "A home funeral allows your loved one to rest in familiar surroundings, giving family and friends the opportunity for private farewells in a comfortable, personal setting. This traditional practice is seeing renewed interest from families who want more time and privacy to say goodbye. We provide all necessary equipment and support to make this possible, including cooling equipment to allow your loved one to rest at home safely for several days. Our team offers 24\/7 telephone support and can visit to ensure everything is arranged properly. This option can be combined with any type of funeral service, allowing the procession to begin from home rather than the funeral parlor.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 17.6px;\">Use our flexible Funeral Estimator to help check any costs here&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/estimator.barringtonsfunerals.com\/#\/\" style=\"font-size: 17.6px;\">Barringtons Funeral Calculator<\/a>",
