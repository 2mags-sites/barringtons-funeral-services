What do you do outside of work<br>Away from work I enjoy the Cinema, cooking and spending time with the family. I also love gadgets much to the teams dismay sometimes when I get excited about something new.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Q. What do you enjoy about working in funeral service.&nbsp;<br>I like to hear peoples stories, about their lives and their history. I like helping people and making the funeral journey easier too. It's a privilege. Lastly I like working with my team who are so supportive of everyone we look after. It's a special place to work.&nbsp;<br>",

With a yearning to move back into a world which involved her Art History Degree background she moved from people and food into running her own art galleries. Latterly, and now with over 15 years experience she joined David within the family business. This brought her drive and continuing eye for detail with the designs of each new Barrington's branch. Her aim was to create places of welcome, trust and calm. <br>For every family we look after, there is always a very high level of care and dedication, with a lean towards listening to what's not said or how we can make the journey forwards and on the day especially relevant and important. The aim is always to provide continuity with the needed support to navigate on through to the funeral. Claire is keen to ensure our standards are kept very high.<br><br>Q: Why did you choose to work within this industry?.<br>A: David had his business and I had my own career. We would come together at the end of the day to decompress and share our stories. When life changed direction and the children came along, the opportunity came about to work together - and so far so good, it has worked!&nbsp;<br><br>Q: What do you do outside of work?<br>A: I enjoy Yoga, watching most sports, always eating great food and going to the Theatre as much as possible.<br><br>",
